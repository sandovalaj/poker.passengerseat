# POKER Program

This is a menu-based program that does not feature ascii art cards (yet) and basically
just mimics the game of poker. There are many options to choose from, whether you want
to just draw 5 random cards or pick them yourself, or maybe play against the computer
by drawing random cards.

The program has 450+ lines of code with functions that I think are done in a readable way.
